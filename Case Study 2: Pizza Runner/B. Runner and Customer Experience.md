SELECT DISTINCT
r.order_id
,order_time
,pickup_time
,DATE_PART('minute', AGE(pickup_time::TIMESTAMP,order_time))::INTEGER AS pickup_minutes
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders r 
INNER JOIN pizza_runner.customer_orders c 
	ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
ROUND(AVG(pickup_minutes),3) avg_pickup_minutes
FROM t

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
```sql
SELECT
c.order_id
,COUNT(pizza_id) qty_pizza
,DATE_PART('minute',AGE(pickup_time::TIMESTAMP,order_time)):INTEGER 
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders c
LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders r 
 	ON c.order_id = r.order_id
GROUP BY 1,2
```
